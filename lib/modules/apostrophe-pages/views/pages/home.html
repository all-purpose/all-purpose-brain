    <p>Thanks for checking out the knowledgebase. I'm still a work in progress, so some things might not work quite right or could look funny, but I'm always getting better.

    <p>You can talk to Nick or Danny about any issues you see, or you can even add them straight to my <a href="https://caldesign.teamwork.com/#/projects/234096/tasks">teamwork project</a>.
