# Allpurpose Brain
_**Built with Apostrophe Boilerplate v2.x**_

## About
Working in the design and development community, I'm sure you've heard the phrase _"Single source of truth"_. With a team brain, any time a team member learns a new topic or a new policy goes into effect this is where the information goes. Save yourself (and your team) time by storing commonly referenced information in one central location. Stop the endless googling and desk hopping trying to figure out the wifi password for your new device.

## Installation
Apostrophe Boilerplate is a minimal starting point for [Apostrophe 2](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe) projects.

To get started, we recommend taking a look at [our guide to creating your first project](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started/creating-your-first-project.html). You could also take a look at [Apostrophe's CLI](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe) or simply fork this repository.

Once you have a local copy of this project to work from, make sure to install its dependencies with `npm install`. With Apostrophe installed, the first thing to do create an admin user account so you're able to log into the CMS. Run the following command (this will prompt you for a password).

```bash
node app.js apostrophe-users:add admin admin
```

Now you're all set! Just run `node app.js` to start up the local server and head to `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
